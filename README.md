# actions-retrieve-ecr-token

This action is a simple way to exchange a Github Token, as provided to a Github Actions run, for credentials that allow pushing an image to an ECR repository. It relies on the availability of a microservice providing this functionality, which will hopefully be open sourced by Inmar in the near future.

Check `action.yml` for descriptions of required parameters.
